/**
 * This package provides basic data types and global constants and variables
 * used during the construction of a gBuild component.
 * 
 * <p>
 * On the one hand, the data types contained on this package are not
 * truly useful for Processing developers, since the language environment
 * already has them. The reason of its implementation is because they're
 * used internally to build components. In other words, it is recommended
 * to do not use them in Processing sketches, but they shall be used on
 * the implementation of gBuild library.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * On the other hand, public constants and variables are another case
 * on which Processing developers might not want to use them on its
 * sketches, but they're definietly recommended for gBuild implementation.
 * However, some variables could be useful to manage components at a
 * Processing sketch, such as the variables related to dialogs.
 * </p>
