 * Public constants and variables for gBuild components

 * 
 * <p>
 * gBuild includes lots of default values for the attributes of
 * UI components, as well as variables that are necessary to
 * implements events on Processing. This class constains all
 * constants and variables that uses gBuild and the developer
 * at Processing language evironment.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some of the variables and constants of gBuild can be customized,
 * but you shouldn't apply any modifications unless you know what
 * are the consecuencies of your changes
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Talking about the use of this class, all variables and constants
 * are static and public, and it is not possible to create a new
 * instance of a Globals class, so object attributes or methods
 * are not allowed.
