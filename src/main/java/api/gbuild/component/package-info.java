/**
 * This package contains the implementation of simple gBuild components
 * the generic definition of one of them, and basic containers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Talking about gBuild components located here, they are designed to
 * be the basic units on which a complex component is formed. This means
 * that a developer which wants to construct its personal UI component
 * can define it by the use of these components.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Relative to generic definitions and containers, this package includes
 * the abstraction of a gBuild component and the basic implementation of
 * a panel. The first one is defined by its location and dimension, and
 * the great majority of the components extens from it, while the second
 * one is the implementation of a container that is composed by components.
 * </p>
