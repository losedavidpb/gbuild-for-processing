/**
 * This package contains the implementation of simple gBuild components
 * used to build complex UI elements.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To manage colors, gBuild offers a data type structure which is used
 * to build easily RGB colors. Developers should use this class whether
 * they want to get a color's property using getProp method
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Components at gBuild are all extensions of an abstraction which
 * contains properties related to location and dimension of a component.
 * Relative to location, developers can get the position of a component
 * considering its parent or ignoring it.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As simple elements, this package provides text and image components,
 * as well as a panel that represents a container of elements. This
 * basic components are used at the great majority of the library to
 * construct complex UI components.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Talking about globals section, gBuild stores all the constants and
 * variables used to define default values for properties at a class.
 * Normally, developers could only be interested in some variables.
 * </p>
