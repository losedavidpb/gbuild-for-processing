/**
 * This package offers the implementation of different types of menus.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Menus at gDialog are formed by a panel that contains a list of
 * options which are clikable and are associated to a key value.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Since the options of menus are truly buttons, there are useful
 * methods that allow Processing developers to manage click events
 * and key events.
 * </p>

 * @since 1.0.0

 * @version 4.0.0
