/**
 * This package provides the implementation of movable dialogs.
 * 
 * <p>
 * By the use of simple graphical components, dialogs are created at
 * gBuild to be customizable. That is to say, Processing debelopers
 * can customize the content of a dialog to have a specific appearance. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Relative to the movement, dialogs can be defined to be static or
 * dynamic. The first type of component won't move from its location
 * if content is not updated, while the second one would move according
 * to the mouse pointer location. Besides, gBuild includes the possibility
 * to define modal dialogs by the use of newDialog constant defined at
 * the globals section of api.gbuild package.
 * </p>

 * @since 1.0.0

 * @version 4.0.0
